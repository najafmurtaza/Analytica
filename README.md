Refer to **Test Lib.ipynb** for examples and usage.

Analytica is a data analysis & manipulation library which has basic functionality like pandas. I created this project in summers break inspired by Dunder Data. It is created from scratch in numpy to get the sense how things in pandas works behind the scenes.

Right now it supports following operations.
